# Treaps (Cartesian tree)
- **Tree + Heap = Treap**  
- X values are **keys**
- Y values are **priorotoes**
- It is a way to balance BST and is called **randomized binary serach tree**

## Operations
- split(node, key) ```O(log(n))```
- merge(A, B) ```O(log(n))```
- insert(key) ```O(log(n))```
- find(key) ```O(log(n))```
- remove(key) ```O(log(n))```
